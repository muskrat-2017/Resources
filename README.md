- [GIT Basics](https://git-scm.com/videos): Git is an open sourced [Version Control System(VCS)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). A VCS records the history of changes to files over time allowing us to return to a previous version of the file. It also provides a workflow that makes collaborating with others possible on large projects.

- [Python Classes And Object Oriented Programming](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2017/03/27/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/): Python Classes are not new. You have actually used them already when you used things like `strings`, `lists`, and `dictionaries`. Each of these is a Python Class the is available right out the box. Soon we will be creating our own classes to help us create DRY and reusable blocks of code.

### Contacts

Create a simple terminal app that allows one user to manage their contacts / personal phonebook. Think about how the contacts app in your smartphone works.

The user can create a contact. A contact must have a name, and can have many email addresses and many phone numbers.

The user can view all their contacts, in alphabetical order by name.

The user can edit the contact's name, and edit or delete email addresses and phone numbers. 

Note - there is no user administration in this app. They do not need to log in to manage contacts. Assume just one person runs one copy of your application.
